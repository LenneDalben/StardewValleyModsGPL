# (CP) Easier Farm Totem and Survival Burger 
This mod allows you to craft the farm totem with lower foraging skill and different resources:
Foraging skill 3, 20 fiber, 10 wood, and 1 red mushroom (or 10 stone), instead of Foraging skill 8, 20 fiber, 1 hardwood, and 1 honey
 Also optionally reverts Survival Burger foraging skill level requirement to 2.


||Configuration||

Config Options:
* Farm Totem Recipe Change: Choose whether the farm totem recipe is changed (true, default) or not (false).
* Farm Totem Option: Choose whether the recipe requires 10 stone (stone) or 1 red mushroom (redmushroom, default). If you set Farm Totem Recipe Change to "false", this setting doesn't do anything.
* Survival Burger Recipe Change: Choose whether the survival burger recipe is changed (true, default) or not (false).
