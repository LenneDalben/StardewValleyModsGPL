# Joja Plans Ahead
Have you ever wanted to plan ahead, just a little, and have your seeds ready to go on Day 1 of the season, without having to wait for JojaMart to open (because you don't shop at Pierre's, or you just want that competitive Sunflowers price), to then run to JojaMart, to then buy the seeds, to then run back to your farm and finally get to planting? Well, now you can!


||Configuration||

Thanks to game version 1.6, there's now a config to easily select between all the options, JojaNumberOfDaysAhead:
* 1 Day in Advance (1, default): JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month. Morris will send you a letter on the 28th of the month to let you know
* 3 Days in Advance (3): JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 26th of the month (so they will sell them on the 26th, 27th, and 28th). Morris will send you a letter on the 26th of the month to let you know
* 7 Days in Advance (7): JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 22nd of the month (so they will sell them from the 22nd-28th). Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know
* 'May' Plan Ahead 1 Day in Advance (Maybe1): JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month. Morris will send you a letter on the 27th of the month to let you know to check JojaMart the next day
* 'May' Plan Ahead Up to 7 Days in Advance (Maybe7): JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds from the 22nd-28th of the month, from the 26th-28th of the month, only on the 28th of the month, or not at all. Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check JojaMart that week
* 'May' Plan Ahead Draylon Edition (Draylon): JojaMart has a random chance to sell some of the next season's seeds, so it's not guaranteed they will sell all types of the next season's seeds (or any seeds, if all of the random checks roll false!). JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on any, some, or none of the days between the 22nd-28th. They could sell a seed on the 22nd that they don't sell the rest of the week, or they could sell it only on some of those days, or not at all! Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check JojaMart that week


||Compatibility||

Lore-Friendly Joja Prices hasn't been updated for 1.6, but with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16209">Price Buffs</a> you'll see even more discouted prices, both before and after becoming a Joja member!

I've been informed that Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE) modifies JojaMart so that they sell the seeds year-round. I don't use SVE, so I have not tested compatibility, but if you have SVE, I'm not sure why you'd need this mod. You could still benefit from Pierre Plans Ahead though, assuming SVE doesn't expand Pierre's stock to be year-round as well.

<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1552317?tab=user+files">Pathoschild</a>, author of SMAPI, without them, this mod wouldn't be possible.

HUGE thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/3590100?tab=user+files">CherryChain</a>, author of Shop Tile Framework (STF), without them, this mod wouldn't be possible either. Extra thanks to CherryChain for their help in the Stardew Valley Discord with troubleshooting. 

<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/2186381?tab=user+files">Digus</a>, author of Mail Framework Mod (MFM), without them, the letter component of this mod wouldn't be possible.
