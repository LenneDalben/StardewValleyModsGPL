# JojaMart Has Extra Stock
Have you ever wondered why JojaMart is described in-game as having competitive prices, and lots of stock, but noticed it doesn't really have either of those? Well, with this mod, they're a little more competitive!

With this mod, Joja's inventory is expanded to include basic cooking ingredients (tortilla, oil, and vinegar), fishing gear (after you unlock it), and coal, at a discount, even for non-Joja-members! To compete more with Pierre, Gus, Clint, and Willy, non-Joja-members will have a 25% off discount, while Joja members have a 50% off discount. The items and discounts are year-round. You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the additional stock.

I think the mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2658">Lore-Friendly Joja Prices</a> will pair well with this one, but note it's not required. 

Installation:

1. Install <a href="https://smapi.io/">SMAPI</a> (version 3.4 or higher)
2. Install  <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005">Shop Tile Framework (STF)</a> (version 1.0.4 or higher)
Optional: if you'd like to receive the letters, you'll also need to install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536">Mail Framework Mod (MFM)</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/LenneDalben/StardewValleyModsGPL/releases/">Download the mod</a> and unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letters or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


Uninstallation:

Delete the folders for this mod from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.
