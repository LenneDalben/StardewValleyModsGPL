# JojaMart Has Extra Stock
Have you ever wondered why JojaMart is described in-game as having competitive prices, and lots of stock, but noticed it doesn't really have either of those? Well, with this mod, they're a little more competitive!

With this mod, Joja's inventory is expanded to include basic cooking ingredients (tortilla, oil, and vinegar), fishing gear (after you unlock it), and coal, at a discount, even for non-Joja-members! To compete more with Pierre, Gus, Clint, and Willy, non-Joja-members will have a 25% off discount, while Joja members have a 50% off discount. The items and discounts are year-round. You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the additional stock.

Lore-Friendly Joja Prices hasn't been updated for 1.6, but <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16209">Price Buffs</a> includes that functionality and will pair well with this mod. It's not required, though. 

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the orders and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.
