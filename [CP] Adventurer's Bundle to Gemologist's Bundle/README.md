# (CP) Adventurer's Bundle to Gemologist's Bundle
This mod changes the Adventurer's Bundle to instead be the Gemologist's Bundle. Pairs well with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6639">Non-Lethal Weapons</a> and pacifist runs as a whole. For more pacifist AND gem-using mods, check out <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5678">Mineral Mage</a>!

The requirements will now be 2 of the following combinations:
1 Ruby
1 Diamond
3 Topaz (stacked)
3 Emerald (stacked)


||Configuration||

The configuration file contains the following options:
* ModToggled: allows you to toggle the mod on and off. Default is on.
* RewardModified: Choose true if you want to have a modified reward, and select RingReward option below. Choose false if you want to have the vanilla reward (small magnet ring). Default is true.
* RingReward: If RewardModified is true, choose slime or magnet. If RewardModified is false, choose N/A.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.
