# Joja Always Has Seeds
Have you ever wondered why JojaMart, an alleged super-powered grocery store, doesn't even sell seeds year round? Well, wonder no more, because now they do!

As it says on the tin, with Joja Always Has Seeds, JojaMart will sell seeds all year round. There are some seeds JojaMart doesn't carry in vanilla game; they still won't (refer to the wiki page on Crops). You'll receive a one-time letter from Morris when you install the mod advertising the change in stock.


||Compatibility||

With Lore-Friendly Joja Prices you'll see discounted prices for the seeds, before and after becoming a Joja member!

If you use Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE), you don't need this mod. If you use Joja Plans Ahead (or Joja 'May' Plan Ahead), make sure you remove that before installing Joja Always Has Seeds.
