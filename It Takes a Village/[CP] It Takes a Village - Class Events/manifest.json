    Updates and fixes 0.9.9:
    * Updated readme to reflect change in plans: I will not add kids from other mods or add lessons led by custom NPCs. If custom NPC mod authors want to add lessons for their NPCs in a similar format, they're welcome to do so in their own mod!
    * Added East Scarp to the list of mods supported by the automatic Load Blacksmith Token
    * Fixed issue with Shane Animal Care CTs that were missing some underscores (thanks tia for reporting!)

    Updates and fixes in 0.9.8:
    * Fixed filename issue for Punchinator 3000's Load patch (thanks nicole for reporting!)
