    /*
    Updates and fixes in 0.9.7:
    * Added Robin woodworking lesson!
    * Added Abigail self-defense lesson!
    * Updated Maru Electronics lesson to use an "animated" temp actor for the potato table instead of warping temp actors in and out (thank you Arknir for the tip!)
    * Created optional Lasting CTs pack to have the option of the CTs lasting until you talk to every last NPC, instead of being governed by the MinimumDaysBetweenLessons config setting. It is a separate folder that has the little period in the name by default to get SMAPI to skip it. If you want to use it, remove the period and the all-caps note from teh folder name.
    * Fixed ProgressionMode default; it is now correctly set to false
    * Fixed WIP Beta issue with Maru and Demetrius CTs for Maru Electronics (thanks tia!)
    * Renamed Harvey Anatomy CT to HarveyAnatomy instead of HarveyHealth
    * Renamed Abigail Economics CT to AbigailEconomics instead of AbbyEcon

    Updates and fixes in 0.9.6:
    * Added ProgressionMode config option: By default, this is set to false. This means the order of the lessons will be completely random and you'll have a chance of seeing wider variety of bonus dynamic dialog. Set this to true if you want events to be grouped and play in a semi-randomized sequence according to the bracket grouping (see spoiler guide for the bracket groupings), but see a smaller variety of dynamic dialog.
    * Added screenshot of Alex PE and Healthy Eating CTs for preview images
    * Updated viewport commands in Abigail video games to use clamp and adjusted viewport coordinates (thanks max!)
    * Fixed bug in Alex PE and Healthy Eating for second quickQuestion option (thanks max!)
    * Updated viewport and Pierre position in Abigail Economics lesson
    * Updated wording, punctuation, and fixed some typos throughout
