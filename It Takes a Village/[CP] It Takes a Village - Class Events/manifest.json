    /*
    Updates and fixes in 0.9.6:
    * Added Robin woodworking lesson!
    * Added ProgressionMode config option: By default, this is set to false. This means the order of the lessons will be completely random. Set this to true if you want events to be grouped and play in a semi-randomized sequence according to the bracket grouping (see spoiler guide for the bracket groupings).
    * Added screenshot of Alex CTs for preview images
    * Updated viewport commands in Abigail video games to use clamp (thanks max!)
    * Updated wording, punctuation, and fixed some typos throughout
