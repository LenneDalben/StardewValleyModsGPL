# (CP) It Takes a Village - Class Events

This mod is in development! Penny will recruit fellow townspeople to teach Vincent and Jas something they know.

Features include randomized order of lessons and semi-dynamic dialog based on which lesson(s) played first! In repeat playthroughs, you may see the lessons in a different order, and with slightly different dialog, some which is seasonal.

||Background||

As a novice eventsmith, I was looking for event modding ideas that would be relatively simple but interesting to implement, and Airyn, who has many wonderful ideas, suggested a lessons series! The idea was "it takes a village to raise a child", so Penny will recruit fellow townspeople to teach Vincent and Jas something they know. This mod has been an incredibly fun labor of love, so I hope you enjoy :)

Each lesson or class is an event, taking place somewhere in Pelican Town. After each class, the townspeople will share their thoughts on the topic or how the lesson went. Some are supportive, some are judgmental, etc. Check out the screenshots for some examples! The Minimum Days Between Lessons config setting is how long the townspeople will share their thoughts for (for modders, these are Conversation Topics).

Fair warning: most of the events have the player being passive or just not there, so if that's not your thing, give the mod a pass.

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||Getting started||

To begin the lesson series, reach 6 hearts with Penny, then visit the town on a sunny day between 9:30am and 6:00pm. An event will play with Penny outside the Library. By default, at least 7 days later, a lesson event will happen somewhere in town! Refer to the Configuration section on how to customize the Minimum Days Between Lessons.

Refer to the spoiler guide for details on activating the other events (a few have weather and/or time conditions).


||Configuration||

Config Options

* Minimum Days Between Lessons: After kicking off the lessons, at least 7 days must pass between the lessons by default. That's how long you have to talk to the villagers after each lesson to hear their thoughts. This also means it'd take at least 18 weeks in-game to see all the lessons and the wrap up event. If you'd like to reduce the time between lessons to see them faster, or increase the time to spread out the lessons even more, you can! You can select a number between 1 day and 28 days for minimum days between lessons.

* Skippable Config: Specify if you want the events in the series to be skippable (true, false). Default is true. Useful if you're worried about getting stuck during an event due to a mod that changes maps.

* Portrait and Sprite Overlay Goggle Config: Specify if you want the Maru electronics lesson to include a portrait and sprite goggle overlay as a fun feature (true, false). Default is true. The overlays were designed for vanilla and Diverse Stardew (DSV), and will work for Seasonal Outfits - Slightly Cuter Aesthetic. If you use any other portrait or sprite mod that affect Maru, Jas, and/or Vincent, you may want to set this to false for immersion.

* Load Blacksmith Config: Set this to false to avoid a Load error if you have a mod that adds events to the Blacksmith shop besides Clint Marriage Mod, Looking for Love, Lucikiel, or East Scarp. Default is true. ITAV automatically detects Clint Marriage Mod, Looking for Love, Lucikiel, and East Scarp so adjusting this setting is not needed for those mods.

* Edit Penny 8 Heart Event: The first question in Penny's 8 heart event is tweaked to include a reference to the lessons. Default is true. This edit is compatible with atravita's Penny 8 Heart Event Adjusted, Hanatsuki's Gender Neutrality Mod, Hanatsuki's Fix Dialog Differences, Not a Farmer - Job Title Replacer, and Villager Name Replacer. Set this to false if you have another mod that edits Penny's 8 heart event.

* Progression Mode: By default, this is set to false. This means the order of the lessons will be completely random and you'll have a chance of seeing wider variety of bonus dynamic dialog. Set this to true if you want events to be grouped and play in a semi-randomized sequence according to the bracket grouping (see spoiler guide for the bracket groupings), but see a smaller variety of dynamic dialog.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

If you have a mod that changes map layouts, use the Skippable Config setting. It will allow you to skip the event if you or an NPC gets stuck.

The discussion after the Shane lesson includes dialog for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9999">Sterling from Always Raining in the Valley (ARV)</a>, if you have ARV installed.

If you're using Event Lookup, events are listed even if they're not actually going to happen that day, because of the random token. There Can Be Only One ITAV event on the same day, regardless of what Event Lookup says.

Writing the vanilla version of this has been a huge undertaking as it is, so I will not add kids from other mods or add lessons led by custom NPCs. If custom NPC mod authors want to add lessons for their NPCs in a similar format, they're welcome to do so in their own mod!

A note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use ITAV and SVE together at your own risk.
