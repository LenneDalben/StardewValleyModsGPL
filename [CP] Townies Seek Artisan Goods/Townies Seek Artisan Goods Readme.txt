||Description||
With Townies Seek Artisan Goods (TSAG), villagers will ask for artisan goods, and reward you with gold and friendship. You'll have variable time to complete the special orders. For the full specifics, refer to the spoiler guide under Miscellaneous Files.


||Configuration||
Config Options
Repeatable: true or false, default is true
IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true (toggle special orders requiring recipes from the island)
OrderType: specify which types of special orders you'd like. By default, all are toggled: jelly, pickle, beer, wine, honey, mead, juice, roe, animal, and machines.

With regards to the "sparseness" of the orders: the game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you'd prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||
Townies Seek Artisan Goods will recognize if you have Quality Artisan Products installed, so special orders requiring quality wine will show up on the special orders board before you have the cellar upgrade.


||Installation||
1. Install SMAPI﻿ (version 3.9.0 or higher)
2. Install Content Patcher (CP)  (version 1.20.0 or higher)
3. Unzip the mod folder of your choosing into Stardew Valley/Mods.
4. Play the game using SMAPI!
