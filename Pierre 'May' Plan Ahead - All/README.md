# Pierre 'May' Plan Ahead
Have you ever wanted to plan ahead, just a little, and have your seeds ready to go on Day 1 of the season, without having to wait for Pierre to open, to then run to Pierre, to then buy the seeds, to then run back to your farm and finally get to planting? Well, now you can!

These versions, 'May' Plan Ahead, are randomized options:

'May' Plan Ahead 1 Day in Advance:

-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month

-Pierre will send you a letter on the 27th of the month to let you know to check his shop the next day


'May' Plan Ahead Up to 7 Days in Advance:

-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds from the 22nd-28th of the month, from the 26th-28th of the month, only on the 28th of the month, or not at all

-Pierre will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check his shop that week


'May' Plan Ahead Draylon Edition:

-Pierre has a random chance to sell some of the next season's seeds, so it's not guaranteed he'll sell all types of the next season's seeds (or any seeds, if all of the random checks roll false!)

-Pierre has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on any, some, or none of the days between the 22nd-28th. He could sell a seed on the 22nd that he doesn't sell the rest of the week, or he could sell it only on some of those days, or not at all!

-Pierre will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check his shop that week

Jonqora, who gave me the idea to use Shop Tile Framework (STF) to make this mod, and many other ideas implemented in the mod.

Draylon, after whom the Draylon edition is named.

Pathoschild, author of SMAPI, without them, this mod wouldn't be possible.

HUGE thanks to CherryChain, author of Shop Tile Framework (STF), without them, this mod wouldn't be possible either. Extra thanks to CherryChain for their help in the Stardew Valley Discord with troubleshooting. 

Digus, author of Mail Framework Mod (MFM), without them, the letter component of this mod wouldn't be possible.

Everyone in #making-mods in the Stardew Valley Discord, who are a helpful and friendly lot!
