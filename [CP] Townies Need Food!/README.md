# [CP] Townies Need Food!

With Townies Need Food (TNF), villagers will ask for cooked meals you can make in the kitchen, and reward you with gold and friendship. You'll have 7 days to complete the special orders.

For the special orders to show up on the special orders board, you must have a kitchen, either from the first house upgrade, or from one of the mods listed in the Compatibility section. With the Content Patcher (CP) 1.24.0 update, the conditions have been updated to check if you know the recipe! No longer will NPCs request a recipe that you don’t already know how to cook. Conditions no longer check for friendship or skill level. The 3.1.0 update includes season checks! Big thanks to Calcite / CopperSun for showing me the way (read the unpacked files in more depth haha). The spoiler guide contains full details about he conditions for the orders and the reward amount.

The NPCs request every vanilla recipe (including from the 1.5 update), with the exceptions of: Strange Bun (because no one in town likes it), Pale Broth and Algae Soup (I've no good reason for excluding these, I just did :I ). The remaining 77 vanilla recipes are spread out over 35 special orders. You may notice that the NPCs ask for recipes they enjoy, hint hint~ The villagers only ask for vanilla recipes (base game), no PPJA / JA recipes.

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the orders and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.

There are preview images in the download, but they're quite large so they're listed at the bottom of the description. :)

||Configuration||

Config Options
* Repeatable: true or false, default is true

* IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true (toggle special orders requiring recipes from the island)

With regards to the “sparseness” of the orders: you have to know how to cook the recipe first, and there are season checks. For full details, refer to the spoiler guide. The game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you’d prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.

||Compatibility||

⚠️⚠️⚠️Make sure you complete or cancel any special orders you had in your journal from TNF first.⚠️⚠️⚠️Once you've done that, delete the folders for this mod from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.

Note that if the game was going to include special orders from TNF in the next round of special orders, you may still see some special orders listed from this mod. They will reset the following week. User stardewswag confirmed they uninstalled TNF and accepted the special order that still showed, and they crashed. Do not accept a special order from TNF after uninstalling it in order to avoid the crash.
