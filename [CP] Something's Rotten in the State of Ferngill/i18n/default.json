  "SomethingRotteninFerngill_CT_Sebastian": "Abigail said she saw something awful in the backwoods, maybe it has to do with that stench in the air?",
  "SomethingRotteninFerngill_CT_Sam": "You had a strange dream, huh? Been there.#$b#You're not sure if it really happened? What was it#$b#%Sam listens.#$b#Nah, no way that happened, that's way too weird!$h",
