# (CP) Something's Rotten in the State of Ferngill

TBD

||Background||

My submission to the Mod Jam!

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||How to progress||

Wake up at the farmhouse to trigger the event. Then, talk to Abigail, Sebastian, Sam, Penny, Maru, Robin, Demetrius, Emily, Harvey, Caroline, Pierre, Wizard, and Pam (if you unlocked bus stop), then visit where they say to visit. You'll receive a letter after the number of days on the DaysTalkingAboutEvent config setting. Follow the instructions to see the wrap up.


||Configuration||

Config Option

* DaysTalkingAboutEvent: By default, after the dream event, the villagers will talk about it for 4 days. If you'd like to reduce how long people talk about the event for, or make them talk about it even longer, you can! You can select a number between 1 day and 28 days for the days people will talk about the event.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

This mod makes a temporary change to the Backwoods map tile X Y. I did my best to make sure it'd be a small edit so it'd be compatible with most maps. However, a note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use this mod and SVE together at your own risk.
