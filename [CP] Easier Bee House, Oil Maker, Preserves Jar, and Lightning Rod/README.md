# (CP) Easier Bee House, Oil Maker, Preserves Jar, and Lightning Rod
This mod makes the following machines require fewer resources to build:
Oil Maker: requires 20 slime instead of 50, and 10 hardwood instead of 20
Bee House: requires 3 coal instead of 8
Preserve Jar: requires 3 coal instead of 8
Lightning Rod: requires 1 bat wing instead of 5


||Configuration||

If you'd prefer to only have some of these changes, you can turn off individual changes to the machines in the config file by setting them to "false" (they all default to true). Default config file:

  "OilMaker": "true",
  
  "BeeHouse": "true",
  
  "PreservesJar": "true",
  
  "LightningRod": "true"

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once.

Carlesama, whose mod More Valuable Diamond was how I learned how easy it could be to modify attributes for items, and inspired me to investigate modifying crafting recipes!

kdau, who helped me set up the code for this mod in the SDV Discord!

Pathoschild, author of SMAPI and Content Patcher, without them, this mod wouldn't be possible.
