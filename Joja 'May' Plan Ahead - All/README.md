# Joja 'May' Plan Ahead
Have you ever wanted to plan ahead, just a little, and have your seeds ready to go on Day 1 of the season, without having to wait for JojaMart to open (because you don't shop at Pierre's, or you just want that competitive Sunflowers price), to then run to JojaMart, to then buy the seeds, to then run back to your farm and finally get to planting? Well, now you can!

These versions, 'May' Plan Ahead, are randomized options:

'May' Plan Ahead 1 Day in Advance:

-JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month

-Morris will send you a letter on the 27th of the month to let you know to check JojaMart the next day

'May' Plan Ahead Up to 7 Days in Advance:

-JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds from the 22nd-28th of the month, from the 26th-28th of the month, only on the 28th of the month, or not at all

-Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check JojaMart that week

'May' Plan Ahead Draylon Edition:

-JojaMart has a random chance to sell some of the next season's seeds, so it's not guaranteed they will sell all types of the next season's seeds (or any seeds, if all of the random checks roll false!)

-JojaMart has a random chance to sell the next season's seeds on any, some, or none of the days between the 22nd-28th. They could sell a seed on the 22nd that they don't sell the rest of the week, or they could sell it only on some of those days, or not at all!

-Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know to check JojaMart that week

Compatibility

With Lore-Friendly Joja Prices you'll see discounted prices for the seeds, before and after becoming a Joja member!

I've been informed that Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE) modifies JojaMart so that they sell the seeds year-round. I don't use SVE, so I have not tested compatibility, but if you have SVE, I'm not sure why you'd need this mod. You could still benefit from Pierre Plans Ahead though, assuming SVE doesn't expand Pierre's stock to be year-round as well.

Installation:

1. Install <a href="https://smapi.io/">SMAPI</a> (version 3.4 or higher)
2. Install  <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005">Shop Tile Framework (STF) (version 1.0.4 or higher)
Optional: if you'd like to receive the letters, you'll also need to install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536">Mail Framework Mod (MFM)
3. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letters or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


If you'd like to switch from the mod version you have to another one, you can simply delete the existing folders you have for this mod, and then install the other version of the mod you'd like to use following the install instructions above.
