||Description||
With Townies Need Artisan Goods (TNAG), villagers will ask for artisan goods, and reward you with gold and friendship. You'll have variable time to complete the special orders. For the full specifics, refer to the spoiler guide under Miscellaneous Files.

||Background||
The Diverse Stardew (DSV) server continues to provide excellent ideas. Special mention goes to Airyn and JeweledNebula, who provided a lot of ideas on what the special orders should be.


||Configuration||
Config Options
Repeatable: true or false, default is true
IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true. Toggle special orders requiring items from the island.
OrderType: specify which types of special orders you'd like. By default, all are toggled: jelly, pickle, beer, wine, honey, mead, juice, roe, animal, machine, and misc.
EasyMode: true or false, default is false. Specify if you want the 3 biggest special orders to be easier by requiring less items. The rewards are adjusted accordingly.


With regards to the "sparseness" of the orders: some orders have seasonal checks, though not all of them. Refer to the spoiler guide for full details. The game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you'd prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||
TNAG will recognize if you have Quality Artisan Products installed, so special orders requiring quality wine and/or cheese will show up on the special orders board before you have the cellar upgrade.

TNAG will also recognize if you have Dinosaur Replacement - Turtle by HohenHeizen installed, and for the special order related to dinosaurs, refer to them as turtles accordingly.


||Installation||
1. Install SMAPI﻿ (version 3.9.0 or higher)
2. Install Content Patcher (CP)  (version 1.24.0 or higher)
3. Unzip the mod folder of your choosing into Stardew Valley/Mods.
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


||Updating||
⚠️⚠️⚠️Make sure you complete or cancel any special orders you had in your journal from TNAG first.⚠️⚠️⚠️Once you've done that, then you can update TNAG by following the install instructions above.


||Un-installation||
⚠️⚠️⚠️Make sure you complete or cancel any special orders you had in your journal from TNAG first.⚠️⚠️⚠️Once you've done that, delete the folders for this mod from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.

Note that if the game was going to include special orders from TNAG in the next round of special orders, you may still see some special orders listed from this mod. They will reset the following week. Do not accept a special order from TNAG after uninstalling it in order to avoid the crash.
