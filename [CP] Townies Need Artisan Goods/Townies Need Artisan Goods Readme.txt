"Townies Need Artisan Goods!"
Author: LenneDalben

Villagers will ask for artisan goods, and reward you with gold, friendship, dialog, and special events!

||Description||
With Townies Need Artisan Goods (TNAG), villagers will ask for artisan goods, and reward you with gold, friendship, dialog, and special events. You'll have variable time to complete the special orders, and some are repeatable while others aren't. For the full specifics, refer to the spoiler guide.


||Background||
The Diverse Stardew (DSV) server continues to provide excellent ideas and were discussing that artisan goods aren't used all that often, thus this mod was born. Special mention goes to Airyn<https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/182160/mods> and JeweledNebula<https://www.nexusmods.com/users/108706758>, who provided a lot of ideas on what the special orders should be.


||Configuration||
Config Options
Repeatable: true or false, default is true. Note that some orders are not repeatable by design. Refer to the spoiler guide for full details.
IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true. Toggle special orders requiring items from the island.
OrderType: specify which types of special orders you'd like. By default, all are toggled: jelly, pickle, beer, wine, honey, mead, juice, roe, animal, machine, and misc.
EasyMode: true or false, default is false. Specify if you want the 3 biggest special orders to be easier by requiring less items. The rewards and duration are adjusted accordingly.
EasterEgg: true or false, default is true. You will see slightly joke-y, slightly not lore-friendly rewards as part of the regular rewards for some orders. If you don't think you can briefly suspend disbelief, set it to false, and you won't see the orders with those rewards.

With regards to the "sparseness" of the orders: some orders have seasonal checks, though not all of them. Most have skill checks, and others have additional requirements like seeing a specific event. Refer to the spoiler guide for full details. The game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you'd prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||
TNAG will recognize if you have Quality Artisan Products<https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/707502-quality-artisan-products> by Wingheart installed, so special orders requiring quality wine and/or cheese will show up on the special orders board before you have the cellar upgrade.


||Installation||
1. Install SMAPI<https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400>﻿ (version 3.13.0 or higher)
2. Install Content Patcher (CP)<https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915> (version 1.24.0 or higher)
3. Unzip the mod folder of your choosing into Stardew Valley/Mods.
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


||Updating||
⚠️⚠️⚠️Make sure you complete or cancel any special orders you had in your journal from TNAG first.⚠️⚠️⚠️Once you've done that, then you can update TNAG by following the install instructions above.


||Un-installation||
⚠️⚠️⚠️Make sure you complete or cancel any special orders you had in your journal from TNAG first.⚠️⚠️⚠️Once you've done that, delete the folders for this mod from your Stardew Valley/Mods folder.

Note that if the game was going to include special orders from TNAG in the next round of special orders, you may still see some special orders listed from this mod. They will reset the following week. Do not accept a special order from TNAG after uninstalling it in order to avoid the crash.
