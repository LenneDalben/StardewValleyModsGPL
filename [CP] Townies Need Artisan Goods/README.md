# [CP] Townies Need Artisan Goods!
With Townies Need Artisan Goods (TNAG), villagers will ask for artisan goods, and reward you with gold, friendship, dialog, and special events. You'll have variable time to complete the special orders, and some are repeatable while others aren't. For the full specifics, refer to the spoiler guide.


||Background||

The Diverse Stardew (DSV) server continues to provide excellent ideas and were discussing that artisan goods aren't used all that often, thus this mod was born. Special mention goes to <a href="https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/182160/mods">Airyn</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/108706758">JeweledNebula</a>, who provided a lot of ideas on what the special orders should be.

It took a lot of effort to learn some new modding skills for the rewards, so I hope you enjoy :)

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the orders and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.

||Configuration||

Config Options
* Repeatable: true or false, default is true. Note that some orders are not repeatable by design. Refer to the spoiler guide for full details.
* IncludeIslandContent: true or false, default is true. Toggle special orders requiring items from the island.
* OrderType: specify which types of special orders you'd like. By default, all are toggled: jelly, pickle, beer, wine, honey, mead, juice, roe, animal, machine, and misc.
* EasyMode: true or false, default is false. Specify if you want the 3 biggest special orders to be easier by requiring less items. The rewards and duration are adjusted accordingly.
* EasterEgg: true or false, default is true. You will see slightly joke-y, slightly not lore-friendly rewards as part of the regular rewards for some orders. If you don't think you can briefly suspend disbelief, set it to false, and you won't see the orders with those rewards.
* LoadAdventurerGuildConfig: true or false, default is true. Set this to false if you have a mod besides Make Marlon Real that adds events to the Adventurer's Guild. TNAG automatically detects Make Marlon Real so adjusting this setting is not needed for it.

With regards to the "sparseness" of the orders: some orders have seasonal checks, though not all of them. Most have skill checks, and others have additional requirements like seeing a specific event. Refer to the spoiler guide for full details. The game picks from a pool of the available orders, so if you'd prefer to get through some of the vanilla special orders first, install this mod later in your playthrough.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

TNAG will recognize if you have <a href="https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/707502-quality-artisan-products">Quality Artisan Products by Wingheart</a> installed, so special orders requiring quality wine and/or cheese will show up on the special orders board before you have the cellar upgrade.

You will also only see these orders if you have these mods installed:
* Integration with Diverse Stardew (DSV): there are non-alcoholic alternative orders for Sam, Gus, and Sandy, for both pre-Core and post-Core. The reward was adjusted accordingly.
* tiakall’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9002">Host Trees</a> (7 orders).
* tiakall’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10950">Jean and Jorts</a> (2 orders, 1 which requires Host Trees).
* Himetart’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9999">Always Raining in the Valley</a> (ARV, 4 orders).
* ZoeDoll’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10671">Alecto the Witch</a> (1 order).

Walk of Life and Skill Prestige: resetting a skill using one of these 2 mods combined with forgetting a recipe may cause issues. If you reset your skills with using one of those mods and set the config to forget a recipe, you will risk a crash. If you want to use those mods with TNAG, set those mods' config so that you don’t forget recipes when you reset a skill.

If you're using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2778">Dinosaur Replacement - Turtle</a>, the dinosaur mayonnaise special order can't be completed. This is because that mod changes the internal name of the item.

A note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I don't use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use TNAG and SVE together at your own risk.
Similarly, any mod that changes the town interior maps will be incompatible with TNAG. Airyn noted Less Ugly Town Interior works fine though!
