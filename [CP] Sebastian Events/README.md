# (CP) Sebastian Events

This mod is in development. Two short Sebastian events and some dialog after, from ideas from tiakall, Airyn, and acearohippo.

||Background||

This mod was born as a mod prompt for familial relationships that turned into discussion about a Realistic Programmer Sebastian mod. This is not a full overhaul, but it's a step in that direction! Shout to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/112768378?tab=user+files">tiakall</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/70148453?tab=user+files">Airyn</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/55639367?tab=user+files">acearohippo</a> for coming up with the ideas.

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||How to trigger the events||

You need at least 2 hearts with Sebastian and seen his 2 heart event, then enter the basement. You have one event that will play when he's in there, and another event when he's not in there. Talk to the villagers after each event for the rest of the content.


||Configuration||

Config Option

* ???

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

A note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use this mod and SVE together at your own risk.
