# (CP) It Takes a Village - Class Events

This mod is in development! NPCs help out Penny teach the kiddos by giving lessons.

Features include semi-randomized order of lessons and dynamic dialog based on which lesson(s) played first!

||Background||

As a novice eventsmith, I was looking for event modding ideas that would be relatively simple but interesting to implement, and Airyn, who has many wonderful ideas, suggested a lessons series! The idea was "it takes a village to raise a child", so Penny will recruit fellow townspeople to teach the kids something they know.

Each lesson or class is an event, taking place around the town. After each class, the townspeople will share their thoughts on the topic or how the lesson went. Some are supportive, some are judgmental, etc. Check out the screenshots for some examples!

Fair warning: most of the events have the player being passive or just not there, so if that's not your thing, give the mod a pass.

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||Getting started||

To begin the lesson series, reach 6 hearts with Penny, then visit the town on a sunny day between 9:30am and 7pm. An event will play with Penny by the Library / Museum.


||Configuration||

Config Options

* MinimumDaysBetweenLessons: After kicking off the lessons, at least 7 days must pass between the lessons by default. This means it'd take at least 16 weeks in-game to see all the lessons. If you'd like to reduce the time between lessons to see them faster, or increase the time to spread out the lessons even more, you can! These are your options for minimum days between lessons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 14 days.

* SkippableConfig: Specify if you want all the events in the series to be skippable (true, false). Default is false. Useful for repeat playthroughs if you want to pick and choose which events you see, or if you're worried about getting stuck during an event due to a mod that changes maps.

* EditPenny8HeartEvent: For immersion reasons, Penny's 8 heart event is tweaked to include a reference to the lessons. Set this to false if you have another mod that edits Penny's 8 heart event. Default is true.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

A note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use ITAV and SVE together at your own risk.
