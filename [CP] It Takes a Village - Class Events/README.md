# (CP) It Takes a Village - Class Events

This mod is in development! NPCs help out Penny teach the kiddos by giving lessons.

Features include semi-randomized order of lessons and dynamic dialog based on which lesson(s) played first!

Background

As a novice eventsmith, I was looking for event modding ideas that would be relatively simple but interesting to implement, and Airyn, who has many wonderful ideas, suggested a lessons series! The idea was "it takes a village to raise a child", so Penny might recruit fellow townspeople to teach the kids something they know.

Fair warning: most of the events have the player being passive or just not there, so if that's not your thing, give the mod a pass.

Getting started

To begin the lesson series, reach 6 hearts with Penny, then visit the town on a sunny day between 9:30am and 7pm.

Configuration
Config Options
SkippableConfig: Specify if you want the first event in the series to be skippable (true, false). If you skip the first event, you will not see the rest of the events. Useful for repeat playthroughs if you don't want the entire series to play. Default is false.

EditPenny8HeartEvent: For immersion reasons, Penny's 8 heart event is tweaked to include a reference to the lessons. Set this to false if you have another mod that edits Penny's 8 heart event. Default is true.

MultipleEventsAWeek: After kicking off the lessons, at least 7 days must pass between the lessons by default, so it would take at least 16 weeks in-game to see all the lessons. If you'd like to reduce the time between lessons to see them faster, or increase the time to spread out the lessons even more, you can! These are your options for minimum days between lessons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 14 days.
