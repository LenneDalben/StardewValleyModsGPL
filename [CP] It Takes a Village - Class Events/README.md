# (CP) Unique Mobile Greetings
NPCs use unique in-character greetings when contacted by the mobile phone. My aim was to keep them short and sweet, so that they sound natural.

A few examples:

Abigail
* Friendly: "Hi, what's new?" / "I'd better go, bye!"
* Dating / Engaged / Married: "Hi!" / "I gotta go sweetie, bye!"
* Divorced: "..." / "Stop calling me, jerk!"

Alex
* Friendly: "Hey you!" / "See ya!"
* Dating / Engaged / Married: "Hey FARMERNAME!" / "See ya, my cutie!"
* Divorced: "*sigh*" / "Lose my number."

Caroline
* Friendly: "Hi {0}, how are you doing?" / "Talk to you later!"

Demetrius
* Friendly: "Greetings FARMERNAME! Are you enjoying this fine day?" / "Goodbye FARMERNAME!"
