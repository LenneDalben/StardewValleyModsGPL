# (CP) Dream

TBD

||Background||

My submission to the Mod Jam!

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||How to trigger the event||

Wake up at the farmhouse.


||Configuration||

Config Option

* DaysTalkingAboutEvent: By default, after the dream event, the villagers will talk about it for 7 days. If you'd like to reduce how long people talk about the event for, or make them talk about it even longer, you can! You can select a number between 1 day and 28 days for the days people will talk about the event.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

This mod makes a temporary change to the Backwoods map tile X Y. I did my best to make sure it'd be a small edit so it'd be compatible with most maps. However, a note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use this mod and SVE together at your own risk.
