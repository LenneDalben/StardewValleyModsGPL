# (CP) Trick or Treat Event

This mod is in development. In a role reversal, the kids are the ones giving candy to the adults for trick or treat!

Includes a randomized treat for the player and people talking about the event after!

||Background||

This mod was born as a mod prompt for Halloween. Shout to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/34250790?tab=user+files">casey</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/114762643?tab=user+files">Calcite / CopperSun</a> for the initial idea. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/70148453?tab=user+files">Airyn</a> also provided useful feedback, per usual <3

Translations are welcome! You can submit either the language.json to me or the strings in another language for all the strings and I will incorporate it into the mod. See more information on the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations">wiki</a>.


||How to trigger the event||

Visit the town between 6:30pm and 9:30pm in the fall on the 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, or 28. The event will play only once, but it can be triggered any day in the last week of fall except for Spirit's Eve, which is the 27th. Talk to the villagers after for the rest of the content. Note that while the event is skippable, if you skip it, you will not get a treat (good things come to those who wait).


||Configuration||

Config Options

* DaysTalkingAboutEvent: By default, after the trick or treat event, the villagers will talk about it for 7 days. If you'd like to reduce how long people talk about the event for, or make them talk about it even longer, you can! You can select a number between 1 day and 28 days for the days people will talk about the event.

Note that the mod does not come packaged with a config file. The config file will be generated after you run the game with the mod installed at least once. 


||Compatibility||

This mod uses a custom temporary map for the event, so it should not conflict with anything. However, a note on Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE): I donâ€™t use it and never will, so I will not add compatibility for it. Use this mod and SVE together at your own risk.
