# Joja Plans Ahead
Have you ever wanted to plan ahead, just a little, and have your seeds ready to go on Day 1 of the season, without having to wait for JojaMart to open (because you don't shop at Pierre's, or you just want that competitive Sunflowers price), to then run to JojaMart, to then buy the seeds, to then run back to your farm and finally get to planting? Well, now you can!

1 Day in Advance:

-JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds on the 28th of the month

-Morris will send you a letter on the 28th of the month to let you know

3 Days in Advance:

-JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 26th of the month (so they will sell them on the 26th, 27th, and 28th)

-Morris will send you a letter on the 26th of the month to let you know

7 Days in Advance:

-JojaMart will sell the next season's seeds starting on the 22nd of the month (so they will sell them from the 22nd-28th)

-Morris will send you a letter on the 22nd of the month to let you know

Pathoschild, author of SMAPI, without them, this mod wouldn't be possible.

HUGE thanks to CherryChain, author of Shop Tile Framework (STF), without them, this mod wouldn't be possible either. Extra thanks to CherryChain for their help in the Stardew Valley Discord with troubleshooting. 

Digus, author of Mail Framework Mod (MFM), without them, the letter component of this mod wouldn't be possible.
