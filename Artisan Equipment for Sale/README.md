# (STF) Artisan Equipment for Sale

Have you ever been rolling in the gold, flooded with cash, or just had some extra money, but you can't craft mayo machines because you don't have enough earth crystals, and you thought to yourself, "it would be great if I could just buy some mayo machines with all this money"? Well, now you can!

With this mod, the shop owners in the valley (and in the desert) will sell artisan equipment after you have unlocked it, every Thursday, and only to their friends.

||Compatibility||

For the machines Marlon sells, there's compatibility built in. If you use Befriend Marlon and Gunther, Make Marlon Real, or Stardew Valley Expanded (SVE), then there is a friendship requirement. If you use none of those mods, there's a different requirement.


||Installation||

1. Install <a href="https://smapi.io/">SMAPI</a> (version 3.9.0 or higher)
2. Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005">Shop Tile Framework (STF)</a> (version 1.0.9 or higher)
3. OPTIONAL: If you'd like to receive the letters, do this step. If you don't want to receive the letters or don't use MFM, ignore this step. Install <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536">Mail Framework Mod (MFM)</a> (version 1.10.2 or higher)
4. <a href="https://github.com/LenneDalben/StardewValleyModsGPL/releases/">Download the mod</a> and unzip the mod folders into Stardew Valley/Mods (if you don't want the letters or don't use MFM, delete the folder beginning with [MFM]).
5. Play the game using SMAPI!

||Shout Outs||

Nexus user kupiqo for providing the German translation for the letter.

Jonqora and Draylon, who helped me with tweaking the requirements to buy the equipment and its availability to balance the mod.

Pathoschild, author of SMAPI, without them, this mod wouldn't be possible.

spacechase0, who gave me some ideas about what to include in the letter.

HUGE thanks to CherryChain, author of Shop Tile Framework (STF), without them, this mod wouldn't be possible either. Extra thanks to CherryChain for their continued help in the Stardew Valley Discord with troubleshooting. 

Digus, author of Mail Framework Mod (MFM), without them, the letter component of this mod wouldn't be possible.
